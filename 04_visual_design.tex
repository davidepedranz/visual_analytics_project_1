\section{Visual Design Study}
\label{sec:visual_design}

\subsection{Type of visualization}
Gapminder is an InfoVis for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data is time-dependent, multidimensional (we consider only $5$ dimensions for this assignment, but the complete dataset of Gapminder has over $500$ dimensions) and non-spatial.
    \item Data attributes have different types: some are categorical (eg. countries), some are discrete (eg. time in years), some are quantitative (eg. average income). 
    \item Not every point is associated to a measured: different datasets are defined over different time periods and some data is missing; it is not possible to find a point between any pair of points since the some attributes are categorical or discrete.
    \item The visualization is interactive and has the scope to look for correlations between different indicators about the world situation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual encoding}
Gapminder offers $5$ different types of chart, called respectively: bubbles, maps, mountains, rankings and lines.
Since each chart uses visual variables in different ways, we analyze each of them separately.

\subsubsection{Bubbles}
Gapminder's ``bubbles'' is a bubble chart with animations.
We consider the particular instance of bubble chart with the income on the x-axis, the life expectation on the y-axis and the population size encoded as the bubbles size; this is the default visualization offered by Gapminder when opening the software.

The visual variables being used are: position, color, size, shapes (text labels) and animations.

\paragraph{Position}
The position is used to encode the value of $2$ indicators: the position along the x-axis encodes the first indicator (in our case the income), the position along the y-axis the second one (in our case the life expectation).
Since both indicators are quantitative, each point in the chart is in a bijective relation with a pair of possible values for the indicators.

Each point in the bubble chart represent a country.
The encoding is very good, since it uses a single visual variable to represent $2$ dimensions of the dataset.
Position is a very powerful visual variable: it is associative, selective, ordinal and quantitative.
The user will thus:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perceive each point independently of the other visual variables used. This allows to use other variables (eg. size or color) to encode additional dimensions of the data.
    \item Perceive each point as different from each other. This allows to easily distinguish countries from each other on the chart.
    \item Be able to easily order the points. This allows to easily tell which countries have lowest and highest values for one indicator and order the countries based on some indicator.
    \item Be able to easily compute ratios between the values of the indicators encoded by each point. This allows to compare the situation of pairs of different countries from the point of view of the $2$ indicator.
\end{itemize}

% Nevertheless, Gapminder allows the user to select other kinds of attributes as well, which might lead to sub-optimal representations.

% TODO: we can force the tool to use categorical data for x-axis / y-axis !!! BAD

\paragraph{Color}
The color is used to encode any of the available dimension of the data.
By default, the tool encodes the world regions using the color, but it is possible to select any other attribute.
The top right corner of the windows, Gapminder shows a colormap for the encoding.
The tool automatically recognize the type of the attribute and uses an appropriate encoding.

In case of the world regions, the tool generates a categorical colormap and represents it a map:
each continent of the world if filled by the color that corresponds to that region.

In case of categorical data, the tool generates a legend for the colors:
each color is associated with a different categorical values.

% TODO: study the colormap encoding

In case of qualitative data, the tool generates a continuos rainbow colormap, ranging from violet to represent the minimum value to red that to represent the maximum.
It is possible to choose between the linear or a logarithmic scale using the dedicated menu;
by default the tool uses a linear scale.

% TODO!!!
The colormap is enriched using labels.
