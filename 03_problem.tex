    \item What is the life expectation of the world population?
    \item Which countries have the highest life expectation?
    \item What was the life expectation of people living in Germany during the Second World War?

    % correlation
    \item Do the countries with the highest income also have the highest life expectation?
    \item Do countries closed to each other have similar incomes?
    \item Do countries closed to each other have similar life expectations?

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Higher-level Questions}
\begin{itemize}

    % life expectation
    \item What is the global trend for the life expectation?

    % correlation
    \item How are life expectation and income correlated to each other today?    
    \item Did the correlation between life expectation and income change over time?
    \item Does the geographical area influence the correlation between life expectation and income?
    \item Does the size of a population influence the life expectation?
    
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Summary}
\begin{itemize}    
    \item What is the world situation in terms of population, average income, life expectation?
    \item How did the situation change over the last 2 centuries?
