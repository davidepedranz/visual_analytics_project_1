\subsection{Type of visualization}
Gapminder is an InfoVis.
It treats non-spatial data and some attributes are categorical (eg. the country) and discrete (eg. the time in years).
Not every point is associated to a measured: different datasets are defined over different time periods and some data is missing; it is not possible to find a point between any pair of points since the some attributes are categorical or discrete.
The visualization is interactive and has the scope to look for correlations between different indicators about the world situation.
