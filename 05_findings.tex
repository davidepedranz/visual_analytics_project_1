\section{Description of Findings}
\label{sec:findings}

Gapminder allows to answer many questions about the global world situation and its evolution over time.
We will try to give an answer to some of them:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the life expectation of the world population?
    \item What is the global trend of the average income?    
    \item What is the world situation in terms of population, average income, life expectation?
\end{itemize}
